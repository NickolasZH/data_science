# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

#### **Project Goal**  
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

---

### **Overview**  
The dataset is divided into two subsets:  

- **Training Set (`train.csv`)**:  
  This dataset is used to train machine learning models. It includes both passenger features and their survival status (ground truth). The model will learn patterns from the features, such as passenger gender, class, and other attributes. Additional feature engineering can be applied to create new informative features.

- **Test Set (`test.csv`)**:  
  This dataset is used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data. It contains the same features as the training set but does **not** include the survival outcome. The task is to predict whether each passenger in the test set survived the Titanic disaster using the trained model.

Additionally, the dataset includes **`gender_submission.csv`**, which provides a sample submission assuming that all female passengers survived. This serves as a reference format for submission files.

### **Data Dictionary**  
The dataset contains the following variables:

| **Variable**  | **Definition**                                | **Key**                      |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `survival`   | Survival outcome                           | 0 = No, 1 = Yes             |
| `pclass`     | Ticket class (proxy for socio-economic status) | 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd  |
| `sex`        | Passenger gender                           | Male/Female                 |
| `age`        | Age of the passenger                      | Numeric                     |
| `sibsp`      | Number of siblings/spouses aboard         | Numeric                     |
| `parch`      | Number of parents/children aboard        | Numeric                     |
| `ticket`     | Ticket number                            | Alphanumeric                 |
| `fare`       | Passenger fare                           | Numeric                      |
| `cabin`      | Cabin number                             | Alphanumeric (some missing)  |
| `embarked`   | Port of embarkation                      | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |

### **Variable Notes**  
- **`pclass`**: Represents socio-economic status (SES):  
  - 1st = Upper class  
  - 2nd = Middle class  
  - 3rd = Lower class  

- **`age`**:  
  - If the age is **less than 1 year**, it is represented as a fraction.  
  - If the age is estimated, it is noted as `xx.5`.  

- **`sibsp`**: Number of family members aboard, defined as:  
  - **Sibling**: Brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister.  
  - **Spouse**: Husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were not included).  

- **`parch`**: Number of family members aboard, defined as:  
  - **Parent**: Mother, father.  
  - **Child**: Son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter.  
  - **Note**: Some children traveled only with a nanny, so their `parch` value is `0`.

## **Project Execution Plan**  

#**1. Data Loading & Initial Inspection**
   - Load the dataset (`train.csv`, `test.csv`) and verify successful loading.
   - Explore the dataset structure, check feature types, and inspect a few samples.
   - Identify missing values, inconsistencies, or formatting issues.

#**2. Data Preprocessing**
   - Investigate missing values and decide on appropriate handling strategies (e.g., imputation, removal).
   - Identify and remove duplicate records if they exist.
   - Convert data types where necessary (e.g., categorical encoding).
   - Standardize and clean textual or categorical variables (e.g., embarked port codes).

#**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions of numerical and categorical variables.
   - Identify anomalies and outliers in numerical features.
   - Explore relationships between features and survival rate.
   - Perform feature selection to identify the most important predictors.

#**4. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**
   - Create a data preprocessing pipeline to automate transformations:
     - Handle missing values.
     - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for `embarked`).
     - Scale numerical features for models that require it.
   - Generate new features based on insights from EDA:
     - **Family size** (`sibsp + parch + 1`).
     - **Title extraction** from names.
     - **Cabin information** grouping (if usable).
     - **Age grouping** to capture age-related survival trends.

#**5. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Split the dataset into training and validation subsets.
   - Train multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.
   - Compare models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Handle class imbalance if necessary (e.g., through resampling techniques).

#**6. Model Evaluation & Selection**
   - Compare different models’ performance on validation data.
   - Choose the best-performing model based on accuracy and interpretability.
   - Analyze feature importance to understand which attributes contributed most to survival predictions.
   - Test the model on the unseen `test.csv` dataset.

#**7. Conclusion & Documentation**
   - Summarize findings from data exploration and feature engineering.
   - Provide insights into why certain features were important.
   - Justify model selection and compare it with baseline models (e.g., gender-based assumptions).
   - Suggest potential improvements for future iterations.
   - Format final submission file and validate results.
